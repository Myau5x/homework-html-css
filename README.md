# Horiseon Web page 
## Example of web page that have accesible and semantic code.

My task was to make code of the website look more proffesional. 

So I need HTML file look more semantic and follows accesibility standarts.
ALso I have to chek that all links works and clean css code.

Next things were done for these purposes:
- some of `div` containers were changed for more meaningful tags, like `nav`, `section`, `aside` etc
- navigations links were checked, and one of them corrected
- several similar classes were joined in css
- `alt` atributes were added to images
- `aria-label` tag was added for background image
