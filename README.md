# Horiseon Web page 
## Example of web page that have accesible and semantic code.

My task was to make code of the website look more proffesional. 

So I need HTML file look more semantic and follows accesibility standarts.
Also I have to check that all links works and clean a css code.

Next things were done for these purposes:
- some of `div` containers were changed for more meaningful tags, like `nav`, `section`, `aside` etc
- changing correponding elements in css file
- navigations links were checked, and one of them corrected
- several similar classes were joined in css
- `alt` attributes were added to images
- `aria-label` attribute was added for background image
